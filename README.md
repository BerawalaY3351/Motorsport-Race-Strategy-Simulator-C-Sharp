# Motorsport-Race-Strategy-Simulator-C-Sharp
A deterministic race strategy simulation engine written in C#/.NET, designed to model tyre degradation, pit stop timing, and race time outcomes for circuit racing.

## Features
- Multi-stint strategy simulation
- Configurable tyre degradation models
- Pit stop loss modelling
- Lap-level race time breakdown

## Tech Stack
- C# (.NET)
- Console application (core engine is UI-agnostic)

## How to Run
```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
